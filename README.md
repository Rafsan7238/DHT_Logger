# DHT_Logger
This repo contains the files for the DHT Logger Project for my CSE360: Computer Interfacing course at BracU. Technologies used include Proteus, Arduino, LabView and Virtual ComPort. 

## Project Statement:
You need to design a microcontroller Based Data Logger system. A data acquisition system (also called a data logger) is a stand-alone data recording system. In this project, a temperature and humidity data logger using a microcontroller will be designed. The data from the temperature sensor is analyzed by the microcontroller and transferred to a PC via virtual com-port. You have to develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI) based on LabVIEW to operate the system.
